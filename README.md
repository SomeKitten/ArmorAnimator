## Comment structure.

Comments are structured this way so you can easily use extensions like the Todo Tree VSCode extension.

-   **TODO** is something that needs to be done
-   **CONSTANT** is a notice that won't change from version to version
-   **NEXT** is a TODO that has priority
-   **FIXME** is a bug (this is considered a subcategory of **NEXT**)
